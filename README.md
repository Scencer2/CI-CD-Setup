# CI-CD-Setup
This project takes a full-stack functioning application and adds a working CI/CD pipeline using Github Actions and Render.
- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Cypress component tests automatically run when a pull request is made to the `develop` branch.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD):** When `develop` is merged into `main`, the app is automatically deployed to Render.
